Repository for Code: You
I am a graduate of UofL with a **Political Science** degree currently working as an HRIT analyst. ~~Life happened~~, law school went out of the picture and now I am trying to branch into the tech world as it is something I enjoy. I hope to learn a lot from this program, and appreciate the time and effort those running it put into it. :smiley: 

I hope to learn 
- [ ] the basics of coding
- [ ] valuable technical skills to grow my knowledge
- [ ] more insight into the different aspects of the tech world

Best,

Alexis
